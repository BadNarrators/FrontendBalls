Project BouncingBalls
===================================

Introduction / Project description
-----------------------------------
Create an application that displays interactive bouncing balls and a navigation panel to
control their behavior


Usage (how to set up, run and use the application)
-----------------------------------
This site doesn't require any specific application or tools, the user can just explore it by clicking on the various buttons to interact with the various animations.


Configuration and technical characteristics
-----------------------------------
Create an application that allows users to create and interact with bouncing balls with the following
requirements:

- new balls should be generated when the use clicks and drags the mouse

- the speed of the balls should depend on the speed of the mouse movement

- the direction of the balls should depend on the direction of motion of the mouse

- the balls should bounce at the edges of the container

- scrollbars should not appear when the balls hit the edges of the container

- the ball movement should have some physicality (wight, gravity, speed)

- it should be possible to 'freeze' and 'resume' the animation

- the user should be able to choose the 'skin' of the balls, colors, images, etc

- the user should be able to make the balls bigger or smaller with keyboard shortcuts and onscreen buttons

- the user should be able to remove balls (e.g. by clicking on them or on a button)

- the user should be able to to increase/decrease the speed of balls with keyboard shortcuts and onscreen buttons

- the page should be page responsive, meaning that when the user changes the size of the page, the balls never go out of their container and all page controls are repositioned to fit the viewport

- add an onscreen counter that displays the current number of balls



Performance is critical for an application of this type. Rather than using setTimeout or
setInterval consider methods that produce smoother animations such as the
requestAnimationFrame() documentation.


Files and project structure
-----------------------------------
The project contains html, css and javascript files:

-'FrontendBalls/PaulTest/withGravity.html', in the root folder there are all the .html files
-'FrontendBalls/PaulTest/js/canvasThingsGravity.js', in the 'js' there are all the .js files
-'FrontendBalls/PaulTest/style/test.css', in the 'style' there are all the .css files


<!-- Features delivered
-----------------------------------
	Homepage:
	-----------------------------------
	The hompage is the key page to our website and we wanted to deliver an amazing experience as soon as the user enters our website. Its main feature is the video in the background. We also added a hamburger menu that displays only on toggle, so the user can enjoy the full screen experience of the video. We also have an expolre button that connects the main page to some news. We wanted to keep the main page as simple as possible and not overload the users with usless information from the main page and confuse them. Last but not least we added our social links and the logo of the company.

	Join us:
	-----------------------------------
	This area contains an application form to gather information from future
	astronaut candidates:
	- First, middle (optional) and last names

	- Contact information: email, phone numbers, address, etc
	- Weight (max 100kg)
	- A shot biography (max 255 characters)
	- Another text area for any other info the user wants to share	

	Astrounauts:
	-----------------------------------
	For this page we developed a list of 21 astronauts grouped in 2 sections: retired and active. Each astronaut has a name, code, bio, photo, age, nationality, years of experience and links to missions in which he has participated. The main feature of this page are the astronaut cards, which contain not only their photo, but also all the information that we mentioned before hided by a simple and effective animation.

	Missions:
	-----------------------------------
	Has 3 sections: Future, Current, Past. Each missions contains all the most important information of it. The navigation bar will be fixed to make easier to navigate in the page for the user.


	News Page:
	-----------------------------------
	There 4 types of news so there are 4 sections: Most Relevant, New Discovery, Space Teams, Latest News.
	For each news the can read the title, the pubblication date and the content.


	Gallery:
	-----------------------------------
	This page shows an image big as the screen, here the user can switch the image showed on the page by clicking on one of the image in the slider or clicking one of the two arrows.
