Project BouncingBalls
===================================

Introduction / Project description
-----------------------------------
Create an application that displays interactive bouncing balls and a navigation panel to
control their behavior


Usage (how to set up, run and use the application)
-----------------------------------
This site doesn't require any specific application or tools, the user can just explore it by clicking on the various buttons to interact with the various animations.


Configuration and technical characteristics
-----------------------------------
Create an application that allows users to create and interact with bouncing balls with the following
requirements:

- new balls should be generated when the use clicks and drags the mouse

- the speed of the balls should depend on the speed of the mouse movement

- the direction of the balls should depend on the direction of motion of the mouse

- the balls should bounce at the edges of the container

- scrollbars should not appear when the balls hit the edges of the container

- the ball movement should have some physicality (wight, gravity, speed)

- it should be possible to 'freeze' and 'resume' the animation

- the user should be able to choose the 'skin' of the balls, colors, images, etc

- the user should be able to make the balls bigger or smaller with keyboard shortcuts and onscreen buttons

- the user should be able to remove balls (e.g. by clicking on them or on a button)

- the user should be able to to increase/decrease the speed of balls with keyboard shortcuts and onscreen buttons

- the page should be page responsive, meaning that when the user changes the size of the page, the balls never go out of their container and all page controls are repositioned to fit the viewport

- add an onscreen counter that displays the current number of balls



Performance is critical for an application of this type. Rather than using setTimeout or
setInterval consider methods that produce smoother animations such as the
requestAnimationFrame() documentation.


Files and project structure
-----------------------------------
The project contains html, css and javascript files:

-'FrontendBalls/withGravity.html','FrontendBalls/randomMov.html', in the root folder there are all the .html files
-'FrontendBalls/js/gravityScript.js','FrontendBalls/js/randomMovScript.js', in the 'js' there are all the .js files
-'FrontendBalls/style/style.css', in the 'style' there are all the .css files


Bonuses delivered
-----------------------------------
	Bonus 1: - making the application more game like, for example by adding rules:
	-----------------------------------
	We setted a few animations to engage the users and allow them to apply some changes to the animations.

    Bonus 2: - adding sounds or music:
    -----------------------------------
    We added some songs to the game that can be accessed by playing "m" on the keyboard.

    Bonus 3: - generate balls of random sizes and colors:
    -----------------------------------
    We added various sliders to allow the users to personalize the animations.

    Bonus 4: - addling backgrounds and images:
    -----------------------------------
    We added different colors and backgrounds to the game.

    Bonus 5: - Gravity:
    -----------------------------------
    Add a slider to adjust gravity and impact the ball movement.

    Bonus 6: - Increase balls size when they encounter the mouse while moving randomly (when hovered):
    -----------------------------------
    Add a slider to adjust gravity and impact the ball movement.
